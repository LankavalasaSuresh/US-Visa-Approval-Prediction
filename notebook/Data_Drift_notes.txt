In Artifact, in data_ingestion -> ingested folder.
We have train and test files.
with train file we will train the model.
But before using the test file for evaluation purpose, we need to check whether there is drift or not inside my test data.
if there is drift we need to fix it.

To detect drift, we can use MLOPS tools called evidently.
It is an opensource monitoring tool and data drift tool.
We can use evidently for many purposes, but currently we will use for data drift purporse.
We will use data drift in model evaluation component.

We can do a experiment and see how to detect data drift...
We already installed evidently in requirement.txt file.
Please refer data_drift_demo_evidently.ipynb file under notebook for experiment related.

We cant say when drift will come, we have to add this pipeline in code, whenever drift is detected, it will give an alert.
