3. Exploring data

In every problem statement, always first separate out numerical and categorical variables while exploring data. 
Numerical variables can be analyzed using statistical measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and percentiles. 
Categorical variables can be analyzed using frequency tables, bar charts, pie charts, or chi-square tests.

in EDA, we have different types of analysis. like univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and time series analysis.

skewness:
Power transformation is the best solution to deal with skewness. It can be done using logarithmic, square root, reciprocal, or any other mathematical function.


After EDA We will have some idea about data and what is the issue with my data. What steps can I take to fix it before training our model in feature enginnering stage.

4. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. It is a crucial step in building accurate machine learning models.

Which ML model you will be using for this data ?
Instead of reliaing on one particular model, i will be picking multiple models and fit the data and check the final report.
Based on that i will deicde which model to use.


##After EDA and Feature Engineering, we will proceed with modular coding , taking EDA and Feature Engineering as considerations.
