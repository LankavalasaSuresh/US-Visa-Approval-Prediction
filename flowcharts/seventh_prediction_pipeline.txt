All our components are completed.
We have also implememted training pipeline.

We also have to write prediction pipeline, because how user can interact with our model by giving his data and get predicted 
whether his us visa will be approved or not ?
lets create prediction pipiline.

pipeline --> prediction_pipeline.

We are adding two constants APP_HOST and APP_PORT in constants file as we are going to create user app.
Here we are going to use FastAPI and it will use above constants.

Update config_entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever user will give data, we have to user our model present in s3 bucket for prediction.

Whatever user is giving as input, we are converting it into dataframe. to covert to dataframe the data should be present in
dictionary format. SO first we are converting to dict and then to dataframe.

After that the prediction pipeline will load the dataframe and model from s3 bucket.
Then it will do the prediction and return the result.

##We will be downloading the model in local from the s3 bucket at time of prediction for first time.
Whenevwe we will do next prediction, we will check whether there is any model present or not. if present then no need to download.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we have to call the prediction pipeline in app.py.
In app.py we are going to use fastAPI.

In FastAPI, There is a get function to receive input through form.

FastAPI will also be using html and css and their codes are present in templates and static folder under us_visa.


Once the code is done. We will launch the UI.
Now we need to run app.py.

##We are not downloading the model, we are just directly loading and doing the prediction.
