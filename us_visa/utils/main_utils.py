# What is utility ?
# The functions we use commonly in our code, we call them as utility functions. They are reusable, maintainable, and easy to understand. They are used to perform specific tasks that are commonly needed in our code.
# Suppose we have 1 yaml file, lets say config.yaml. suppose we need to read that yaml file to get some info. To do so we created a yaml reader function to read the file. 
# lets say while doing data ingestion, we might need to read this yaml file multiple times. This utility function can be used in those places.
# Instead of writing the same code multiple times inside each component, we can use this utility function. This makes our code cleaner and easier to maintain.
# The same function which we wrote initially can be reused in other parts of our code.

# Some of utility functions which we need for our project are below:
# Some of them may not be required, but still we have listed them here for reference.
